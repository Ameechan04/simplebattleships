HOW TO RUN:
Due to C compiling differently on different devices, I strongly urge the user to copy the C files contents into the #Online #C #Compiler found here:
https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/

This ensures that functionality remains consistent across devices.

It is for this same reason that a header file has not been used as it cannot be added to the C compiler.

I hope you enjoy trying out this simple project.
