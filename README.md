# simplebattleships
Simple game of battleships made in C for fun


To verify that the ships do not overlap, a function will be made. I this function, the entrire array will be copied into the temp_arr. Then if the vaidation fails, it will exit and return false. If it works then it will copy the temporary array into the real array and return true.
